# Emoncms 9.1 - Swiss-Solar-Log.ch enhanced version

This is an enhanced version for Swiss-Solar-Log.ch maintained by Andreas Messerli. Full credits go out to EmonCMS (OpenEnergyMonitor Project) and Chaveiro who has done the major improvements of the new EmonCMS.


Emoncms is an open-source web application for processing, logging and visualising energy, temperature and other environmental data and is part of the [OpenEnergyMonitor project](http://openenergymonitor.org/emon).

**Version 9 of emoncms has been developed by [Chaveiro](https://github.com/chaveiro/) with a significant list of improvements, the EmonCMS 9.0 RC forum thread with full change log can be found here [http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/11009](http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/11009)**

## Branches

* [v9.0](https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms/tree/9.0) - see [EmonCMS 9.0 RC forum thread](http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/11009)

* [v8.5](https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms/tree/v8.5) - Version 8.5 focused emoncms around a core set of timeseries storage engines: phpfina, phpfiwa and phptimeseries. The data request api was improved and the way data requests are made make it easier to make cross feed comparisons. The myelectric and node modules have been removed, replaced with new optional modules that improve on the functionality of these modules called the app module and nodes module.

* [low-write (v8.5)](https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms/tree/low-write) - The current emonpi/emonbase emoncms version. Low-write mode is now available in v9.0. The low write version of emoncms is designed for running on SD cards. This is a cut down version of emoncms supports only the phpfina and phptimeseries feed engines (no in built feed averaging or histograms) and a reduced input processor set.

**Optional modules**

Optional modules can be installed by downloading or git cloning into the emoncms/Modules folder. New for version v8.5 are:

- App provides application specific dashboards for emoncms: myelectric, mysolar, mysolar&wind, myheatpump. git clone https://github.com/emoncms/app.git

- Nodes provides a RFM12/69 focused alternative to the input module, with support for receiving and sending node data over the RFM network. The Nodes module has been developed to complement and integrate closely with emonhub node defenintions and configuration. git clone https://github.com/emoncms/nodes.git
    
- Config provides an in-browser emonhub.conf editor and emonhub.log log viewer. git clone https://github.com/emoncms/config.git
    
- Wifi provides an in emoncms wifi configuration interface designed for use on the emonpi. git clone https://github.com/emoncms/wifi.git

There are many other modules such as the event module and openbem (open source building energy modelling module) that are available, check out the emoncms repo list: https://github.com/emoncms
